# Decision-Tree-Classifier
This repository is just to provide you with an overview related to the decision tree classifier model.

Decision tree classification is a machine learning algorithm that is used for solving classification problems. 
It is a type of supervised learning algorithm, meaning it requires labeled training data to make predictions. 
The goal of decision tree classification is to create a model that can predict the class or category of a given input sample based on its features.

The decision tree classification algorithm builds a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. It partitions the input data based on different features and their values. 
The splitting process is based on finding the feature that provides the most information gain or reduces the impurity the most at each step.

Decision tree classification has several advantages, including interpretability, handling both categorical and numerical features, and being robust to outliers. 
However, decision trees can be prone to overfitting if the tree is too complex or the dataset has noise.
